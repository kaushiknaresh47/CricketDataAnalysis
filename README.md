# Cricket Batting Position/Segment Analysis

A cricket team has 11 players who come in to bat at positions 1-11. We could analyze how scoring patterns for these positions impact game outcomes.

These positions are also categorized into segments: 

* top order (positions 1-4): these are usually specialized batsmen whose focus is to set the pace of the innings and give a good start to the game (the wicket keeper is sometimes in one of these positions)

* middle order (positions 5-7/8): these are usually either batsmen or more oftenly all rounders, who bat and bowl, and thus are not too specialized at either, but definitely lean towards being better at one (the wicket keeper is sometimes in one of these positions)

* lower order (positions 8/9-11): these are almost always specialized bowlers (very rarely heavily bowling oriented all rounders) who are not very important to the batting cause and thus do not come higher in the order
